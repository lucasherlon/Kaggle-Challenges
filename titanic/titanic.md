## Solution for the Kaggle's Titanic problem with Naïve-Bayes
- challenge to predict who would survive to the Titanic shipwreck, based on gender, age, fare and other independent variables
- the kaggle platform gives two files, one for training the algorithm and another for the prediction test
- in this challenge was used the Naïve-Bayes algorithm
- the result file has only the id of the passenger and the dependent variable of the problem (die: 0, survive: 1)
